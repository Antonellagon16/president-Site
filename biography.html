        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>William McKinley was born on January 29, 1843, in Niles, Ohio. He was the seventh of nine children in a
            working-class family. His father, William McKinley Sr., was an iron manufacturer, and his mother, Nancy
            Allison McKinley, was deeply religious.</p>

        <h2>Military Service</h2>
        <p>At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, McKinley enlisted in the Union Army at the age of 18. He served
            with distinction and was promoted several times, reaching the rank of brevet major by the end of the war.
            His experiences in the war shaped his views on leadership and patriotism.</p>

        <h2>Political Career</h2>
        <p>After studying law and passing the bar, McKinley entered politics. He served in the U.S. House of
            Representatives from 1877 to 1891, where he became known for his strong advocacy for protective tariffs. He
            later became Governor of Ohio (1892-1896), where he focused on industrial growth and economic policies.</p>

        <h2>Presidency (1897-1901)</h2>
        <p>McKinley was elected as the 25th President of the United States in 1896. His presidency was marked by
            economic prosperity, a strong stance on international affairs, and the Spanish-American War (1898). The
            victory in the war led to the U.S. gaining control of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.</p>

                <h3>The Tragic Event</h3>
                <p>On September 6, 1901, President William McKinley was attending the Pan-American Exposition in
                    Buffalo, New York. While greeting the public at the Temple of Music, he was shot twice in the
                    abdomen at close range by anarchist <strong>Leon Czolgosz</strong>, who concealed a revolver under a
                    handkerchief.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-5">
            <h3>Medical Treatment & Decline</h3>
            <p>After the shooting, McKinley was rushed to a hospital where doctors attempted to remove the bullets. One
                bullet was extracted, but the other remained inside his body. Initially, McKinley seemed to recover, but
                infection set in due to unsanitary surgical conditions. His health rapidly deteriorated, and he died on
                <strong>September 14, 1901</strong>, eight days after being shot.
            </p>

        <div class="mt-5">
            <h3>Death & Final Words</h3>
            <p>Surrounded by his wife Ida and close friends, McKinley accepted his fate, reportedly saying:</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                "It is God's way. His will be done, not ours."
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-5">
            <h3>Leon Czolgosz's Fate</h3>
            <p>Czolgosz was quickly arrested at the scene and later sentenced to death. He was executed by electric
                chair on <strong>October 29, 1901</strong>, just 45 days after McKinley's death.</p>
